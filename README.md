# Microsoft Movie Pitch Project
Author: Trystan Knowles & Jalil Sarwari

#
This project analyzes trends in movie data to pitch recommendations about what types of films would perform the best for a new studio, in this case Microsoft. Descriptive analysis of multiple data sources suggests that of animal intake and outcome data shows that some animals require extended stays and that the number of sheltered animals varies seasonally. The Austin Animal Center can use this analysis to adjust outreach, hiring, and space utilization to improve resource allocation.


To start off I am given a list of tables in varying formats from TN, TMDB, RT, IMDB, and BOM. These cover varying topics from individual movie budgets to what movies an actor has been in.


# Business Problem
Key Points
Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations. The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Microsoft) should take.

# Data
Data sources were from different  oninemovie databases The Numbers, The Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, and Box Office Mojo. File formats included .csv, .tsv, and .db. Information included specific characteristics about each movie, such as which actors starred in a movie, to overarrching data like a movie's box office performance.
