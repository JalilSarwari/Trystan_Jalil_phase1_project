# Microsoft Movie Pitch Project
Author: Trystan Knowles & Jalil Sarwari

# Overview
This project analyzes trends in movie data to pitch recommendations about what types of films would perform the best for a new studio, in this case Microsoft. Descriptive analysis of multiple data sources suggests producing a movie in the horror, thriller, or romance drama would produce the greatest return on investment (ROI) for a company seeking to break into the movie industry. Suggestions also included specific recommendation on directors to choose for each genre based on their respective ROI's, as well as a range of movie runtimes for each genre.

# Business Problem
Microsoft is seeking to break into the movie movie business. What types of films should they create? What attributes should each one have? What types of films will give them the mazimum return on investment?

# Data Understanding and Analysis
Data sources were from different databases. The ones we focused on were The Numbers, The Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, and Box Office Mojo. File formats included .csv, .tsv, and .db. Information included specific characteristics about each movie, such as which actors starred in a movie, to overarrching data like a movie's box office performance.

To do this, the data was sorted and grouped to be able to draw these conclusions, and then sorted to find specific information based on each genre.

#Conclusion
Microsoft should pursue making a movie in the categories Horror, Thriller, or Romance. The runtime for each film should be between 90 and 110 minutes. The directors we recommend for each genre, according to highest ROI, are Horror - Chris Lofing, William Brent Bell, James Wan, Thriller - Chris Lofing, James Wan, Levan Gabriadze, and Romance - David Lowery, Josh Boone, Ryan Coogler.
